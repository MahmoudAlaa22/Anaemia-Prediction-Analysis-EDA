## Dataset Overview

The **Anaemia Prediction** dataset includes information on hemoglobin levels and pixel color distribution from images. The aim is to use these features to predict whether a person is anaemic.

### Dataset Information

- **Number of Rows:** 104
- **Number of Columns:** 6
- **File Format:** CSV

### Features
- `Red Pixel`: Percentage of red pixels in the image.
- `Green Pixel`: Percentage of green pixels in the image.
- `Blue Pixel`: Percentage of blue pixels in the image.
- `Hb`: Hemoglobin level (in g/dL).
- `Sex`: Gender of the individual (M/F).
- `Anaemic`: Target variable indicating whether the individual is anaemic (Yes/No).

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Read Data**: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration.
3. **Change Column Names**: Rename columns for better clarity and consistency.
4. **Check for Missing Values**: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Clean and preprocess features, including encoding categorical variables.
6. **Data Visualization**: Visualize data distributions and relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts.
7. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between features and the target variable.
8. **Data Cleaning**: Remove outliers and clean the data for better model performance.
9. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict anaemia, including Linear Regression.
10. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
11. **Visualizing Results**: Compare real test values versus predicted values to evaluate model accuracy.
